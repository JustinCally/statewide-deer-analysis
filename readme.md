Analysis Plan:

-   Use a regularised horseshoe prior

-   Use a negative binomial distribution

-   Use 1km2 spatial accuracy

-   Account for imperfect detection using an integrated model

-   Poisson - Poisson link model relating counts of pellets to Population Size

-   Predict within the model
